## Getting Started

To run the project locally, follow the steps below.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following tools installed on your machine:

- **Node.js** (>= 18) - [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- **npm** or **yarn** (package manager)
- **React Native CLI**
- **JDK** (Java Development Kit) version 11 or higher
- **Android Studio** (for Android development)
- **Xcode** (for iOS development, macOS only)
- **CocoaPods** (for iOS, macOS only)

### Installation

#### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arwa-mili/pfe-front.git
cd pfe-front
```

#### 2. Install dependencies

```bash

yarn install
```

#### 3. Android Configuration

##### Install Android Studio

1. Download and install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
2. Open Android Studio and install the necessary SDKs:
   - Android SDK Platform 33 (or higher)
   - Android SDK Build-Tools
   - Android Emulator

##### Configure environment variables

Add the following lines to your `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, or `~/.bash_profile` file:

```bash
export ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Library/Android/sdk  

export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/emulator
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools
```

Then reload your configuration:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc
```


#### 4. Run the application

##### For Android & IOS

```bash

# or
yarn start

# or
yarn android
```

#### 5. Available scripts

```bash
# Start the Metro bundler
yarn start

# Run on Android
yarn run android



# Check code with ESLint
yarn run lint
```

### Troubleshooting

#### Common issues

**Error: "Unable to load script"**
```bash
# Clear cache and restart
npm start -- --reset-cache
```

**Android build error**
```bash
# Clean the Android project
cd android
./gradlew clean
cd ..
```



**Reinstall all dependencies**
```bash
# Remove node_modules and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules
yarn install
```

## Architecture

The project architecture is designed to be modular, scalable, and maintainable. It is based on the following principles:

- **Feature-based project structure:** The source code is organized in the `src/features` folder, where each major application feature (authentication, profile, chat, etc.) has its own directory. This allows for better separation of concerns and facilitates maintenance.
- **Centralized state management with Redux:** The global application state is managed by Redux Toolkit, which provides a simplified and efficient way to manage state. Redux Persist is used to save certain parts of the state (such as user information and authentication token) in the device's local storage.
- **API layer with RTK Query:** Communication with the backend is handled by RTK Query, a powerful data fetching and caching library for Redux. It simplifies API request management, data caching, and error handling.
- **Navigation with React Navigation:** Navigation between different application screens is managed by React Navigation. The application is divided into several navigation stacks (for authentication, main flow, and doctor flow) for clear screen organization.
- **Reusable components:** Reusable UI components are placed in the `src/components` folder, which promotes visual consistency and code reuse.
- **Internationalization:** The application is designed to be multilingual using the `i18next` library.
